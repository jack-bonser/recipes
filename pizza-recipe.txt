For the dough
	
	450g strong white bread flour, plus more to dust
	7g sachet fast-action yeast
	2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve
	350ml warm water

For the topping

	about 5 tbsp roast tomato sauce (see tip below), or stir together 100ml passata and a crushed garlic clove
	8 tomato
 	(green, orange, red, yellow - all different shapes and sizes)
	your choice of toppings: goat's cheese (with rind), grated Parmesan or Parmesan shavings, handful rocket, prosciutto

Method

For the dough, put the flour, yeast and 2 tsp salt into a large bowl and mix. Make a well. Mix the oil and water in a jug,
then tip into the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to work the liquid into the flour – it will seem pretty wet. Set the bowl 
aside for 15 mins. Leaving the dough like this will save you from lengthy kneading later.

Turn the dough onto a well-floured surface, flour your hands, then knead it very gently for about 2 mins until 
it is fairly even, soft and bouncy. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with oiled cling film, then let it rise in
a warm place (or in the fridge overnight) until doubled in size.

When ready to cook, heat oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9 or as hot as it will go, then put a baking sheet in on a high shelf.
Dust another sheet with flour. Split the dough into 8, then roll 3 balls thinly into rough circles. 
Lift onto the floured sheet. Smear over a thin layer of the sauce, scatter over a few slices of tomato, season, 
then add sliced goat’s or grated Parmesan cheese if you want to. Slide the sheet on top of the heated sheet. 
Bake for 12 mins or until golden and crisp and the tomatoes are starting to caramelise around the edges. 
Top with any fresh toppings, then drizzle with more olive oil to serve.
